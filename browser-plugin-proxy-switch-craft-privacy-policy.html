        <h1>Privacy Policy for Proxy Switch Craft</h1>
        <p>Effective Date: July 17, 2025</p>

        <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
        <p>
            Proxy Switch Craft is a browser extension designed to help users
            easily manage and switch proxy settings. We value your privacy and
            are committed to protecting your personal information.
        </p>

        <h2>2. Information Collection</h2>
        <p>
            Proxy Switch Craft does <strong>not</strong> collect, store, or
            transmit any personally identifiable information. All proxy profiles
            and most settings are stored locally in your browser and are not
            shared with any third party. However, proxy rules may use browser
            sync storage to synchronize across devices. These synchronized rules
            are not stored locally, but are managed by your browser's sync
            service and are not transmitted to any external server by this
            extension.
        </p>

        <h2>3. Permissions</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Storage:</strong> Used to save your proxy profiles and
                extension settings locally.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Proxy:</strong> Used to manage and switch your browser's
                proxy settings.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>WebRequest:</strong> Used to apply proxy rules to your
                browsing activity. No browsing data is collected or transmitted.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>4. Data Security</h2>
        <p>
            All data managed by Proxy Switch Craft remains on your device. We do
            not access, collect, or transmit your browsing activity or proxy
            configurations.
        </p>

        <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
        <p>
            This extension does not use any third-party analytics, advertising,
            or tracking services.
        </p>

        <h2>6. Changes to This Policy</h2>
        <p>
            We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Any changes
            will be posted on this page with an updated effective date.
